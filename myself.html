    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <h3>PURPOSE OF WRITING</h3>
 
      It is said that there is no smoke without fire but at this point the
      source of the smoke may sound funny but it is not suppose to be because it
      is actually a good way of teaching. Writing my own biography at this
      particular moment was never in the list of things I planned doing. Writing
      this little piece, facts about me was prompted by
      <strong>Mr. Fidelis, the CEO fidexcode.</strong> The writinng came as the
      first official project from him to test my knowledge on the basic elements
      of html we have treated. It is on this ground that I wish to state that
      <strong
        >though this bears the name "About me", it may not contain every
        information about me and some of the informations that will be provided
        here may also not be original information about me being that it is
        mainly used for educative and practice purpose.</strong

       <strong> I am Patrick Mbam Izuchukwu.</strong> I was born to the family of mr and mrs Christopher

        <h1>CHILDHOOD AND UPBRINGING</h1>
        AS a child i grew up in a family where displine was valued, being born to a no nosense displinarian,
i grew up with much fear of commiting any thing that will attract the wrath of my parents, my dad especially.
      As  a child a grew in a community where respect for elders was valued and the same time 
      communal living  this but never stop the fact that we look for troubles 
      sometimes bu thtis always attsracted punishment that leaves history
      on my skin each time I got meyself inolved on it.

      <h2>FAMILY BACKGROUND</h2>
      The family of Mr and mrs Christopher Mbam was and is still a christian family.
       The family could be said to an average family <em> PARTIALY</em>. I said partially because 
       the turning of things and experiences with poeple have changed my conception of what it means for one or
       a family to average.

      <h2>EARLY MEMORIES</h2>
      Growing up as achild I had alot of memories but one of them has remain very dificult for me to forget
      and this is nothing again but the incident of one sweet-sad saturday.
      On this very saturday, I came back from school but it was differnt 
      from other days coming back from school because this particular day
      was to mark the end of my being a primary school pulpil._ When I came back from 
      school the joy of completing primary so much overwhelmed me that i could not keep my ass at a place ,
       I resisted
        every advice from my mother to 
      stay at place  untill something which I choose not to mention here happened.
      That day's incident thaught me realy a bitter lesson that turned my sweet moment to sad one
       instantly.
